# Compiler_Design_306L

## Basics
1. Write a C program to copy the contents from one file to another [link](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Basics/file_copy_program.c)
2. Code a DFA in C to recognize strings ending with '01' [link](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Basics/string_recognizer.c)

## Week 1: Language recognizer
1. Write a program in C that recognizes the following languages:
    - Set of all strings over binary alphabet containing even number of 0’s and even number of 1’s. [link](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Week_1_Language_recognizer/even_binary_strings.c)
    - Lab Assignment: Set of all strings ending with two symbols of same type. [link](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Week_1_Language_recognizer/same_type_endings.c)

## Week 2: Implementation of Lexical analyzer using C
2. Implement lexical analyzer using C for recognizing the following tokens: [link](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Week_2_Implementation_of_Lexical_analyzer_using_C/lexical_analyzer.c)
    - A minimum of 10 keywords of your choice
    - Identifiers with the regular expression : letter(letter | digit)*
    - Integers with the regular expression: digit+
    - Relational operators: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=
    - Storing identifiers in symbol table.
    - Using files for input and output.
