# Compiler Design (CSE 306L) - Course Assignments

Welcome to the Compiler Design (CSE 306L) course assignments repository. Here, you'll find a collection of well-structured assignments and projects related to compiler design. Each assignment is designed to help you explore and implement various concepts in the field of compiler design. Let's dive into the assignments:

## Basics

### 1. File Copy Program in C
This simple yet essential program allows you to copy the contents from one file to another. It's a fundamental utility often used in various applications. Check out the [code here](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Basics/file_copy_program.c).

### 2. DFA for Recognizing Strings Ending with '01'
In this assignment, you implement a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) in C to recognize strings that end with '01'. DFAs are essential in lexical analysis and pattern recognition. Explore the [code here](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Basics/string_recognizer.c).

## Week 1: Language Recognizer

### Recognizing Specific Language Patterns in C

#### - Even Binary Strings
Here, you create a C program capable of recognizing strings over the binary alphabet that contain an even number of 0's and an even number of 1's. Understanding such language patterns is vital in compiler design. Dive into the [code here](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Week_1_Language_recognizer/even_binary_strings.c).

#### - Lab Assignment: Strings Ending with Same Type
This lab assignment involves implementing a program to recognize strings that end with two symbols of the same type. It's a practical exercise in language recognition. Explore the [code here](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Week_1_Language_recognizer/same_type_endings.c).

## Week 2: Implementation of Lexical Analyzer using C

### Lexical Analyzer for Recognizing Tokens
In this advanced assignment, you develop a lexical analyzer in C capable of recognizing various tokens, including:
- At least 10 keywords of your choice
- Identifiers with the regular expression: letter(letter | digit)*
- Integers with the regular expression: digit+
- Relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- Storing identifiers in a symbol table
- Utilizing files for input and output. This project provides hands-on experience in building a key component of a compiler. Dive into the [code here](https://github.com/ArjunPramod/Compiler_Design_CSE_306L/blob/main/Week_2_Implementation_of_Lexical_analyzer_using_C/lexical_analyzer.c).
